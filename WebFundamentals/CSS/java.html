           <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
           <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the object of these environments to provide programatic control over them
           <ul>
             <li><span class="item">Variable Declaration </span>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers.  <span class="highlight">var x</span></li>
            <li><span class="item">Variable Assignment </span>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class="highlight">var x = 10</span></li>
            <li><span class="item">Data Types </span>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data types.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="highlight">true</span> or <span class="highlight">false</span>; null - <span class="highlight">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="highlight">42</span> or <span class="highlight">3.14159;</span> string - <span class="highlight">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="highlight">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="highlight">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
             <li><span class="item">Conditionals</span>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks on values or conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements: <span class="highlight">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="highlight">else if</span> to specify a new condition to text, if the first condition is false, <span class="highlight">else</span> we execute this block of code;<span class="highlight">var x</span></li>
             <li><span class="item">Loops</span>There are many differnet kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat in an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track track four times adn then you stop.  Thats a loop!</li>
             <li><span class="item">Function</span>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example inagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
