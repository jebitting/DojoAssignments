pip list give me a list of installed packages.  Freeze and list seem to
do essentially the same.  I made the requirements document twice 
using freeze and list and it had the same packages listed in the file 
with the package versions.

pip show Django gave the info about the package, what it is, the website, etc

pip uninstall removed the package

pip search flask gave a lot of information about the modules in flask
